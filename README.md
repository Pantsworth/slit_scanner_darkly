# slit_scanner_darkly
Slit scanning. From frames to weird final product.

This is a repository that allows for creating several types of slitscans.

Dependencies:
PIL http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
Hickle https://github.com/telegraphic/hickle
Numpy http://www.numpy.org/


Single Slitscans:
Single slitscans come in two flavors: horizontal and vertical. This style of slitscan is inspired by Adam Magyar's (http://www.magyaradam.com/) Urban Flow project.

Moving Slitscans:
Like the single slitscans (horizontal and vertical), but compiled over ~all~ the images in a sequence. Each new frame
is a single slitscan from a different x or y coordinate.
